1. a) Why java is important on internet? Explain. 
->

> java follow the oops concept (object oriented programming language) in java evet thing is object and class. it allow us to develop programs or software structre way.
  java is not plateform dependent java use javac compiler it convert java file into classfile that class file execute by jvm so in java every data type use a same byte on various 
  machine thats why java support wora it means wirte ones run anywhere

 > java also support oops concept it allow us to resuce code and reuse the code.
 > java also have grabage collection it automatically collect garbage value and free the memory for other use so you don't need to handle garbage valuse like in c.
 > Also java don't support pointers, pointer diract work with memory location so might be it make mess in software.
 > Java support multi-threading so you can use multiple threads at a same time.
 > java8 include so many feature like generice, lamda functions and many more 
 > java update thier verion in every year also introduce LTS version it stand for long time support
 > java has larg community so it have large support with that so if you have any issue or querys it might high chance to get your solution very quick. 

b) Write a java program using command line arguments, and explain. 
-> 

    //simple example of java hello world
    public class HelloDemo{
        public static void main(String[] args){
            System.out.println("Hello wrold");
        }
    }

    1. Make folder with Name of JAVA
    2. Save this file into JAVA folder give name HelloDemo.java
    3. Open cmd goto that folder using folder structre cd/.././ 
    4. Wirte javac HelloDemo.java ~ it compile the code and create the .class file
    5. Now java HelloDemo it will execute the java .class file & show output into cmd



2. a) Write a java program using any five String library functions. 

package programs.assigments.exams;

public class StringQes {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String str1= "java is follow the oops concepts";
        String str2 = "hello java";
        String str3 = "hello JAVA";


        //it concat other string 
        System.out.println(str1.concat(" "+str2));

        //give Char of index
        System.out.println(str1.charAt(3));

        //get string using substring for both str1,str2 and compair both are same or not
        System.out.println(str1.substring(0,3).equals(str2.substring(6,9)));

        //getting length of string
        System.out.println(str1.length());

        //copairing string ignoring Case
        System.out.println(str3.compareToIgnoreCase(str2));
    }
}


    
b) Describe java garbage collection mechanism? 
->
    Garbage collection it manage to collect garbage value
    if any variable or any resource not doing any opration but they occupied the memory.
    java garbage collect take memory form them and free the memory and resource for other opration or use.


3. Describe in detail various java forms of inheritance. 

    1. Single levels
    2. Multi levels
    3. Multiple {not support in java}
    4. Hierarchical
    5. Hybrid 

4. a) What is CLASSPATH? Describe various levels of access protection. 
->  

b) With an example explain java nested interfaces. 
->


5. a) Create a java program to generate and catch an 
ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, and with an example prove that always 
finally block will execute. 
->
        package programs.assigments.exams;

        import programs.assigments.days.day1.finalll;

        public class exceptionHandling {
            public static void main(String[] args) {
                int[] nums = {1,2,3,4};
                try {
                    System.out.println(nums[5]);
                } catch (Exception e) {
                System.out.println("Exception :"+e);    
                }
                finally{
                    System.out.println("In the finally block");
                }
            }
        }



b) Briefly discuss the concepts of multi threading. 
-> 
    multi threading it allow us to run both threads in one time 
    not waiting whole time for one part of code will execute 
    it allow to execute morethan one block of code execute with simultaneously.
